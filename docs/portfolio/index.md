# [Intro](/portfolio/#intro)

Almost 2 years of experience

Software Developer with a Master's degree in Chemistry. And before you start judging me for not having a degree in Computer Science, let me tell you something. Chemistry is already a science and I have a computer in front of me, so if you put those together... that's it, you've got it!

Jokes aside, I love coding for the web. Currently, I develop front-ends by tweaking UIs so that they don't piss off the user. We don't want that for sure.

I used to be a science blogger because I love science too. And I also own a personal blog where I used to write about my personal views on life and learning. It's in Serbian (my native language), so if you come from the same geolocation as I do, type in my full name in the browser and read away!

### Otisak (Fingerprint)

In under 4 months of part-time dedication I've managed to singlehandedly build this platform using Vue.js and Firebase as a serverless solution. The platform consists of two major parts â€” website and dashboard. Website is open to the public, so feel free to check it out by clicking the link within the colorful card.

Dashboard, on the other hand, can be accessed only by registered users. The logic spreads over several highly intuitive pages with a dark mode option and role based authorization: 

- Companies related analytics
- Company management
- Comment management
- User management
- Settings that includes database synchronization scripts (cost-effective solution)
