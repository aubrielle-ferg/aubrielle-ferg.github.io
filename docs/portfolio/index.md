## :wave: Briefly About Me

Frontend specialized Software Engineer with a focus on the product; navigating the realms of TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Vue and other newer technologies. Crafting seamless and engaging user experiences is my forte.

## :man_technologist: Work Experience

Worked on a variety of projects, ranging from enterprise-level applications to start-up ventures. My technical expertise includes the creation of clean front-end architectures, interactive data presentation on the web and the establishment of necessary CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and provide good developer experience.

Splitting complex workloads into manageable, time-boxed tasks has allowed me to effectively organize and contribute to team dynamics and ensure a successful incremental delivery. Also, I had a chance to prove my ability to inspire colleagues and initiate projects that drive innovation and progress.

### Side Projects

[Otisak](https://otisak.org) Data Protection Platform (Sep – Dec 2021) – European Union funded project, conducted by Association Pravilaw that implements the Law on Personal Data Protection in Southern and Eastern Serbia municipalities – In under 4 months of part-time effort I've managed to singlehandedly build this platform which consists of two major parts — public website and private dashboard that can be accessed only by registered users and admins. The logic spreads over several highly intuitive pages with a dark mode option and role based authorization: companies related analytics and their management, comments management, user management and settings page that includes database optimization scripts and sidebar ad setup section.

I used to build lots of mini apps back in the day, some of them to address certain problems and other just for fun (learning). You can find all of these on [my Github profile](https://github.com/lazarkulasevic).
