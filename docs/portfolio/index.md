    summary: Increased my proficiency in various areas through active contributions to diverse projects and teams. Played an important role in developing a live user interaction monitoring platform, where I worked on both the front-end and CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins with Slack notifications. Actively participated in agile meetings, defined user stories and effectively prioritized tasks to ensure successful delivery. Overall, I focused on ongoing feature development, improvements and bug fixes while consistently proposing new technical and product features and offering effective design solutions for new requirements. Nonetheless, demonstrated my attention to detail and commitment to quality work by implementing pixel-perfect designs and animations.

### VOD Platform

During my employment at Symphony, I came up with an idea to improve already-in-place knowledge-sharing practices. Soon after, a team was formed around the idea until we released the first version of the product that is currently in use. I took the advantage of a fresh start to establish the processes of Trunk-based development and Kanban. Developed CI/CD pipelines and generously contributed to the project architecture and code quality by unit testing vital app parts.

### Otisak

In under 4 months of part-time dedication I've managed to singlehandedly build this platform which consists of two major parts â€” public website and private dashboard that can be accessed only by registered users and admins. The logic spreads over several highly intuitive pages with a dark mode option and role based authorization: companies related analytics and their management, comments management, user management and settings page that includes database optimization scripts and sidebar ad setup section.

### Mini side-projects

I used to build lots of mini apps, some of them to address certain problems and other just for fun. You can find all of these on [my Github profile](https://github.com/lazarkulasevic).
