# [Brief Intro](/portfolio/#intro)

Front-end oriented Software Developer with {{ Utils.getRoundedAge('01 Dec 2020') }} years of professional experience. So far I've worked on several different projects that included some serious challenges, such as advanced data remapping and manipulation on client-side, establishing clean front-end architecture for new technical features, interactive data visualization, building CI/CD pipelines, but also some fine-tuning work such as pixel-perfect development.

### Otisak (Fingerprint)

In under 4 months of part-time dedication I've managed to singlehandedly build this platform using Vue.js and Firebase as a serverless solution. The platform consists of two major parts â€” website and dashboard. Website is open to the public, so feel free to check it out by clicking the link within the colorful card.

Dashboard, on the other hand, can be accessed only by registered users. The logic spreads over several highly intuitive pages with a dark mode option and role based authorization: 

- Companies related analytics
- Company management
- Comment management
- User management
- Settings that includes database synchronization scripts (cost-effective solution)
