# [Intro](/portfolio/#intro)

Software Developer with a Master's degree in Chemistry. And before you start judging me for not having a degree in Computer Science, let me tell you something. Chemistry is already a science and I have a computer in front of me, so if you put those together... that's it, you've got it!

Jokes aside, I love coding for the web. Currently, I develop front-ends by tweaking UIs so that they don't piss off the user. We don't want that for sure.

I used to be a science blogger because I love science too. And I also own a personal blog where I used to write about my personal views on life and learning. It's in Serbian (my native language), so if you come from the same geolocation as I do, type in my full name in the browser and read away!
