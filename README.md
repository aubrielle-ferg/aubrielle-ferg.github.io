# VitePress Portfolio Website and Blog

I have created my personal portfolio website using VitePress - Vite and Vue powered static site generator.

The source code is being maintained on the `master` branch, while the build is being deployed to `gh-pages` branch using Github Actions from where it's being hosted via Github Pages.
